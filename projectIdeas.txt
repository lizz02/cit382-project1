Project Ideas:

Idea 1: Fishing Mini-Game
	Game that responds to mouse events and uses timers to test if user reacted in 
	the alloted time. If yes, a fish is "caught," and a random species from a Fish
	object is presented to the player. Each fish caught is recorded by the program
	so the player can view their fishing history. 

Idea 2: COVID Regulations By State
	An interactive map of the US that reports public health measures implemented by
	each state government. Clicking on a state will pull up information for that 
	state. Map will default to displaying legistlation from the federal government
	before a state is clicked by the user. 

Idea 3: Headline Generator
	A program that resembles social media platforms like instagram and twitter to 
	allow the user to scroll through information quickly. News headlines will be 
	presented to the user, along with a breif description and photos from the article.
	If the headline is of interest, the user can click a link to be redirected to the
	article. If not, they can simply continue scrolling.
